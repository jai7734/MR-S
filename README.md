Project Name: MR. S (AI Agri Assistant)
Tagline: A vertical AI platform specializing in hyperlocal agricultural intelligence and support.

Concept & Vision:
This project represents the strategic evolution of the MR. S AI engine from a general-purpose assistant into a specialized "Agri Assistant." The goal was to leverage the core capabilities in voice, search, and data retrieval and apply them to the critical challenges faced in agriculture, creating a one-stop-shop for modern farmers.

Core Features & Technical Execution:

Specialized AI Engine: Adapted the original MR. S's RAG and multi-agent architecture to process agricultural data, curating knowledge bases from local farming manuals and organic certification guidelines to power accurate, context-aware responses.

Multi-Modal Interaction:

Voice-First in Telugu: Utilized OpenAI's Whisper for robust speech-to-text and fine-tuned open-source LLMs (Llama 3) to ensure fluent and accurate Telugu comprehension and output.

Visual Disease Diagnosis: Built a custom image pipeline with PyTorch and OpenCV, training EfficientNet models on a curated dataset to provide instant, offline-capable disease classification.

Predictive Planning: Developed algorithms that synthesize user input, real-time weather API data, and crop growth stages to generate actionable, week-by-week planning calendars and proactive alerts.

Integrated Agri-Services Suite:

Knowledge Hub: Step-by-step guides for value addition (waste recycling), business legalities, and adopting new global farming tools.

E-Commerce Module: A full-featured marketplace built with React and Node.js, allowing farmers to create storefronts, list products, and manage transactions.

Community & Map Services: A forum for user interaction and geolocation features to find nearby input shops, leveraging Google Maps API.
